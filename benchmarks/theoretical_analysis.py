Theoretical Analysis of Low-Rank SHAP

This module provides formal theoretical analysis including:
1. Accuracy bounds for Low-Rank SHAP approximation
2. Convergence analysis of coalition sampling
3. Error characterization as a function of rank
4. Mathematical guarantees for the approximation quality

This strengthens the research contribution with formal theoretical foundations.
